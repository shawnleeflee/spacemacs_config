# spacemacs_config
This is my spacemacs config

In my .my_init.el , you can find some useful functions for org mode.
I find out that there is no usable solution for automatically refile done-state todos,
I wrote it myself.
The last serveral functions is recommended for experienced emacs users.
If you want it to work on your machine , you need some configuration.
And if you have a better solution , I'll be pleased if you tell me.
